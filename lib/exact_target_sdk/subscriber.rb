# Assumes that the "SubscriberKey feature" is not enabled on your account, and
# thus explicitly sets the SubscriberKey to be the same as the EmailAddress
# (and vice-versa). This allows all methods to be used without ever needing to 
# refer to the SubscriberKey (just use EmailAddress).
#
# If the SubscriberKey is explicitly set, it will be left alone (in case you do
# have the SubscriberKey feature enabled).
#
# When updating, the email address may be updated by setting the SubscriberKey
# property to the current email address, and the EmailAddress property to the
# new email address.
